## ... use a linter

It doesn't exist specific & well maintained Assemblyscript linter in the ecosystem.

As the Assemblyscript is written in Typescript files, the recommendation is to use a linter for Typescript.

The best maintained remains nowadays ESLint

-   Dependencies installation are taken into account at initialization script level.

-   A config file `.eslintrc.json` is copied automatically at root level in your generated project

Keep in mind that a lot of false positives will remains undetected by ESLint such as :

-   Closures
-   Spreads
